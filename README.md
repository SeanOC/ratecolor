==========
RATE COLOR
==========

This is a simple toy script written to play around with a 
[blink(1)](http://thingm.com/products/blink-1.html) and the bitly clickrate
api.

You will need tornado installed to run the script.  Otherwise just run
`python ratecolor.py --help` and you should be able to figure everything
out from there.
